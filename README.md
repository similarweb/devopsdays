# SimilarWeb Challenge

Welcome to the SimilarWeb Challenge, this challenge checks your technical skills both on the system & coding part.
Your goal is to fix the things we "accidently" broke within the docker container and make sure the code run successfully.
Within the container there's an Nginx acting as reverse proxy to a python web-server, your job is to figure out what's broken and present us a working container forwarding the traffic to a working python web server.
If you managed to make it work, you'll enter a lottery for a cool gift!

You can start the challenge by running: `docker pull similarweb-devopsdays`, when you run it, make sure to bind the exposed port.

Good luck!
